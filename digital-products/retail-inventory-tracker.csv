TIPS FOR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
============================================
1. Conduct physical counts weekly or monthly
2. Use ABC analysis (A=top 20%, B=next 30%, C=bottom 50%)
3. Set reorder points based on lead time + safety stock
4. Track shrinkage (theft, damage, admin errors) separately
5. Review slow-moving items quarterly for markdowns

============================================
STATUS CODES

"In Stock","Quantity above reorder point","No action needed"
"Low Stock","Quantity at or below reorder point","Reorder soon"
"Out of Stock","Quantity is zero","Reorder immediately"
"Discontinued","Product being phased out","Sell remaining stock"
